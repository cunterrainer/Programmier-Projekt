Wind energy, another prominent renewable energy source, utilizes the kinetic energy of wind to generate electricity. Wind turbines, typically installed in wind farms, consist of large blades mounted on a tower. As the wind blows, it causes the blades to rotate, which in turn spins a generator to produce electricity. Wind energy is particularly effective in areas with consistent and strong winds, such as coastal regions and open plains. One of the key advantages of wind energy is its scalability; wind farms can range from a few turbines to hundreds, depending on the available land and wind resources. Furthermore, technological advancements have led to the development of more efficient and quieter turbines, addressing some of the earlier concerns associated with wind power
